A website for a cafe called "Broko Bean" using React and Tailwind. Formik and Yup for the contact form. Deployed on Heroku, see it live [here](https://broko-bean.herokuapp.com/) (it will take a moment to load).

Practicing layouts and tailwind for the most part, including making sure it looks good on mobile. This was a quick project. Original design after having a look at various cafe websites to see what I did/didn't like.
