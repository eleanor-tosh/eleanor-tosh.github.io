Flygility is a sport in New Zealand where dogs race against each other to complete a set of obstacles, collect a tennis ball, and return over the obstacles to their handler.

The aim of this app has three main areas:

One: A place for flygility competitors to record their dogs details and current flygility results.

Two: For competitors/club admin to create, access and enter flygility events.

Three: For event organizers to run flygility tournaments including creating a random draw of dogs to race against each other, record and publish results.

The tech/methods used includes: React, Redux, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, CRUD, RegEx.

The project is not complete, one thing I want to re-do is all the styling as well as creating the above features.
