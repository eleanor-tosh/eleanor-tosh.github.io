## 3/4/2023 - 30/6/2023 (Three months)

I successfully completed a dynamic and immersive three-month web developer internship, which significantly enhanced my technical skills and industry knowledge. During this period, I actively contributed to various web development projects for both internal and external clients, gaining hands-on experience in front-end technologies. Through this internship, I honed my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and gained experience using a content management system (CMS) to create a rich editing experience for static sites generated (SSG's) using Hugo, Eleventy and Jekyll. This experience provided me with a solid foundation working in a professional environment, collaborating with developers, experience working with design files and completing designer-developer feedback cycles.

Projects that I worked on include:

* Converting the "Vonge" template (which this portfolio is based on) from Jekyll to Hugo for clients to use on CloudCannon.
* Adding features to the Hugo "Vonge" template following a client request.
* Create components for an external client for them to use on their live website, including working with other developers, Figma design file and designer (full feedback cycle).
* Converting a Hugo template into an Eleventy template for use on CloudCannon.
* Creating a new Hugo template from a Bootstrap template for use on CloudCannon. This involved consulting with the marketing team to determine the best type of template to create which fills a hole in existing library, has a great user experience, and awesome potential re-use for clients. Following from this is a planned demo to showcase how the template can be used to create a website for a completely new business without typing any code.
